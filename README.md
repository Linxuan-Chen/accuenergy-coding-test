# Description

This is a pre-interview coding test project for Accuenergy.

## Demo

You can find a demo [here](https://linxuan-chen.github.io/accuenergy-coding-test/).

Or you can find source codes [here](https://github.com/Linxuan-Chen/accuenergy-coding-test/tree/master).

## How To Use

You can input exact address/location name in any language, then press search button or press enter key on your keyboard to search for details.

Your location button is to relocate the map to your current location, and please allow your broswer to access to your location infomation before use it.

A red marker will be generated on designated location based on keywords searched. An infomation window will be opened by default. You can close it by click cross sign, and you are able to reopen it by click on the marker.

Clocks will show UTC time and time of selected location automatically.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
